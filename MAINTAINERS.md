# List of Maintainers and Coordinators

We'll keep this list up-to-date as much as possible, but currently there are some chores we need to finish.

## Current Maintainers and Coordinators

| Scrren/Legal Name | GitLab SaaS Username | Email and PGP Keys | Keybase Profile | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Andrei Jiroh Halili | @ajhalili2006 | <ajahlili2006@gmail.com> / PGP Key: TODO | TODO | Project Coordinator[^2], @RecapTime/squad member[^1] |

[^1]: Not all of @RecapTime/squad subgroup members are our ~~employees/contractors~~ official squad members. Some of them are either volunteers from the wider open-source community, and some are even outside OSS working on other aspects such as instance administration and content moderation, legal and finance as volunteers too.
[^2]: Project coordinators are also called as project leaders since they also lead the project other than being part of the maintainers' team and coordinating with other project coordinators and maintainers in our other OSS projects.
